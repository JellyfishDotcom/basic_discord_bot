# no_simp_discord
I have a friend who acts really weird when a woman appers on the server where we play. So i create this **discord bot** to send him messages like "Hey, stop being a simp bro when he and a girl are connected at the same time in a chanel voice. And the bot is gonna silence him to avoid the simp things that he says in every situation of this kind.

I'd use the discord.py library to make this project posible.
